# Checks if the supervisor routed the query to the correct agent.
# Compares the predicted intent (e.g. "policy", "account_status", "escalation")

# A judge LLM reads the context + answer and scores how well every claim
# in the answer is supported by the context. This catches hallucination —
# when the model invents facts not present in the retrieved documents.
# Note: faithfulness ≠ factual correctness. An answer can be faithful to
# WRONG context (retriever returned the wrong doc but the LLM quoted it accurately).

# the right facts?" (e.g. correct dollar amounts, percentages, thresholds).

# ===================================================================
# EXTRA: Using DeepEval metrics inside LangSmith evaluators
# ===================================================================
# LangSmith's evaluate() accepts any callable, and a DeepEval metric is just
# an object with a measure() method, so you can wrap one in the other and get
# DeepEval's score + reason in the LangSmith experiments UI next to
# routing_accuracy / correctness. No official integration is needed.
#
# Example (same (run, example) signature as the evaluators in Segment 6):
#
#   from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase
#   from deepeval.metrics import FaithfulnessMetric
#
#   def deepeval_faithfulness_evaluator(run, example):
#       answer = run.outputs.get("answer", "")
#       context = run.outputs.get("context", "")
#       question = example.inputs.get("question", "")
#       if not answer:
#           return {"key": "deepeval_faithfulness", "score": 0.0}
#       tc = LLMTestCase(
#           input=question,
#           actual_output=answer,
#           retrieval_context=[context] if context else ["No context retrieved."],
#       )
#       metric = FaithfulnessMetric(threshold=0.7)
#       metric.measure(tc)
#       return {"key": "deepeval_faithfulness", "score": metric.score, "comment": metric.reason}
#
# Then add it to evaluators=[...] in the evaluate() call. HallucinationMetric
# (uses context=) and the G-Eval empathy metric (input + actual_output only)
# wrap the same way.
#
# Gotchas:
#   - Build the metric INSIDE the function. measure() stores score/reason on
#     the object, so a shared instance races under concurrent evaluation.
#   - DeepEval defaults to async_mode=True and starts its own event loop.
#     If you hit "event loop is already running", pass async_mode=False.
#   - DeepEval calls OpenAI directly with its own judge model, not judge_llm.
#     Those calls are not traced in LangSmith and are billed separately.
#   - In DeepEval 4.x all three scores are 0-1, higher is better, so they
#     drop straight into LangSmith's scoring convention.
