"""
Module C Demo: Input & Output Guardrails
-------------------------------------------
Demonstrates why guardrails are needed — and how they save money.

Guardrails work at TWO levels:
  INPUT:  Block dangerous queries BEFORE the LLM call (saves cost)
  OUTPUT: Validate/redact the response BEFORE the user sees it

Four implementation strategies, each catching what the previous can't:

  STRATEGY 1 — REGEX:      Fast, free, deterministic. Catches known patterns.
                           SSN formats, competitor names, harmful keywords.
  STRATEGY 2 — MODERATION: OpenAI Moderation API. Free, ~100ms.
                           Catches violence, self-harm, hate by intent.
  STRATEGY 3 — ML/NER:     Presidio. Local ML model, no API key.
                           Catches names, emails, addresses regex can't.
  STRATEGY 4 — LLM-BASED:  GPT classifier, Guardrails AI CompetitorCheck.
                           Understands MEANING. Costs ~$0.001/call.

This demo shows:
  Part 1: BEFORE    — Run dangerous queries with NO guardrails (costs LLM calls)
  Part 2: AFTER     — Input regex guard blocks them BEFORE LLM (saves LLM calls)
  Part 3: MODERATION— OpenAI Moderation API (free) catches violence/hate/self-harm
  Part 4: INJECTION — LLM classifier catches rephrased prompt injection attacks
  Part 5: OUTPUT    — Guardrails AI: RegexMatch (regex) + CompetitorCheck (LLM-based)
  Part 6: OUTPUT    — Presidio: ML-based NER catches PII names regex can't
  Part 7: FULL      — Complete guarded pipeline (all strategies combined)

Prerequisites:
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  pip install guardrails-ai-regex-match guardrails-ai-competitor-check
  python -m guardrails_ai.competitor_check.post_install

FOUR STRATEGIES, each catching what the previous can't:

  STRATEGY 1 — REGEX:        Fast ($0, ~1ms), deterministic.
    Input:  Blocks SSN extraction, financial advice, competitors, harmful content
    Output: RegexMatch catches SSN patterns in responses

  STRATEGY 2 — MODERATION:   OpenAI Moderation API. FREE, ~100ms.
    Input:  Catches violence, self-harm, hate, harassment — intent, not keywords

  STRATEGY 3 — ML/NER:       Presidio. Local ML, no API key, runs offline.
    Output: Catches names, emails, addresses that regex can never match

  STRATEGY 4 — LLM-BASED:    GPT classifier + Guardrails AI CompetitorCheck. ~$0.001/call.
    Input:  Catches rephrased prompt injection attacks regex misses
    Output: Understands MEANING — catches rephrased competitor mentions

TWO LEVELS — guard BOTH sides:
    Input:  Block dangerous queries BEFORE the LLM (saves cost)
    Output: Validate/redact the response BEFORE the user sees it

Prompts SUGGEST behavior. Guardrails ENFORCE it.

In the exercise, you'll build:
  TODO 1:   Input guard — regex content safety (Part 2)
  TODO 2:   Guardrails AI RegexMatch (Part 5)
  TODO 3:   ToxicLanguage + CompetitorCheck (Part 5)
  TODO 4:   Safe pipeline: input guard + agent + Guardrails AI
  TODO 5:   Presidio PII detection (Part 6)
  TODO 6:   Full guarded pipeline (all strategies combined)
  TODO 7:   OpenAI Moderation API (Part 3)
  TODO 8:   Prompt injection classifier (Part 4)
